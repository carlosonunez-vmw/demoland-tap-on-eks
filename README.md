# TAP on Kind!

This repo documents how to install TAP on Kind through a series of scripts.

## Caveats

- I wrote this while learning TAP. Don't use this for anything production.
- This will probably light your computer on fire!
- Probably not suitable for POCs either, unless it's something super quick.

## How to Use

Every script starts with a number. Run them in order!
