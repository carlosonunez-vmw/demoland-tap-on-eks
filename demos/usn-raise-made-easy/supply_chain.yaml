    # GATE 5: Must provide DAST
    # 
    # How this works:
    #
    # - A `ClusterDelivery` called `secure-delivery-dast` responds to this
    #   `Deliverable` through the selector `frameworks.doncio.navy.mil/requires-raise: "true"`.
    #
    #   This `ClusterDelivery` is the same as `delivery-basic` with the additional step below.
    # - The `secure-delivery-dast` `ClusterDelivery` creates a Tekton ClusterTask `Runnable`
    #   via the `app-dast` `ClusterDeploymentTemplate`
    # - The `ClusterTask` runs OWASP ZAP against the URL that was deployed by
    #   `secure-delivery-dast`.
    #
    # Design considerations:
    #
    # - **Isolation**: Since you are using this Deliverable to scan a website that is
    #   deployed and exposed to a real environment, you'll probably want to run this in a cluster
    #   that does not have Internet access.
    #
    #   This means that you'll need a `run` cluster that waits for new images that are signed off
    #   from this supply chain and deploys them to your desired target environment.
    #
    #   This can be accomplished either with GitOps (see the `commit-and-pr` ClusterTask) or
    #   with a `scanning-image-scan-to-url` Supply Chain that waits on an image to be
    #   `PUT` into an image registry.
