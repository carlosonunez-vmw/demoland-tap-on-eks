# Demo: Inner Loop Iteration with C++ on TAP

This demo demonstrates how TAP leverages buildpacks to make containerized
development iteration fast and tight with C++.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- `kubectl`
- AWS CLI.

## Resounding Messages

### Stop setting up local dev envs with App Live Update and Buildpacks

App Live Update works with Buildpacks to make testing your apps in a production-like environment
locally right from your IDE super easy.

### 3KP

- The Build Service eliminates the need for Dockerfiles.
- App Live Update eliminates the need for Docker Compose or similar abstractions
  for containerized dev envs.
- TAP's IDE plugins bring these features right to VSCode or IntelliJ.

### Preparing for the demo

#### Environment

1. If needed, run `aws configure` and provide your AWS credentials when prompted.

> ✅  You don't need to do this if you're already logged into the
> AWS CLI.

> ✅ ## Skipping `aws configure`
>
> If you do not want to run `aws configure`, create a file
> called `$HOME/.aws/credentials` that looks like
> the file below:
>
> ```ini
> [default]
> aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
> aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
> aws_session_token = YOUR_AWS_STS_SESSION_TOKEN_IF_APPLICABLE
> ```

2. Run `98-update-eks-kubeconfig.sh` at the root of this repo to update your system's Kubeconfig with a
   context that's compatible with App Live Update.
3. Run `8-set-up-dev-namespace.sh` at the root of this repo to create the dev namespace for our demo app
   along with its "testing" pipeline.

#### Frontend

1. Deploy the frontend's config secrets:

```sh
ytt -v secretKey="$RANDOM_32_CHAR_STRING" \
    -v serverHost="press-the-button.apps.$TAP_DOMAIN" \
    -v backendHost=press-the-button-backend \
    -v backendPort=1234 \
    -f ./frontend/conf/secrets.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

2. Create the Postgres `ClassClaim`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f ./frontend/conf/database.yaml
```

### Running the demo

#### Demo Flow

In this demo, you're going to:

- Start an App Live Update session on a simple TCP server in C
- Change the response from the server and view the change with App Live Update
- Deploy the TCP server as a `server` Workload into TAP
- Deploy a Django-powered frontend for the TCP server into TAP as a `web`
  workload and view it in the browser

#### Backend Live Update

3. Run `code $PWD/backend/main.c`. This will open VSCode and bring you straight into
   the star of this show. Open a terminal underneath the code; we'll use it
   later.
4. Right click anywhere in the source code pane and select "App Live Update
   Start".

   A terminal should pop up beneath the source code pane and logs streaming from
   `tanzu apps workload apply` within it.
5. Go to the terminal that you opened. Run `telnet localhost 1234`. You should
   see `Welcome from the Tanzu Application Platform!` pop up.
