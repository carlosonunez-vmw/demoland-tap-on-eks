## Resounding Messages

### Completely codify your path to production

While our out-of-the-box supply chains are battle-tested and are designed
to fit most people's delivery needs, custom supply chains enable you to
design how _your_ team gets to production end-to-end.

### 3KP

- Supply Chains are defined in a single Kubernetes YAML manifest. No more Jenkinsfiles
  that aren't in source control.
- Resources within Supply Chains are reusable in other Supply Chains
- Every resource created by a Supply Chain is stamped with common labels
  to simplify tracking and auditing.

### Choreography frees your build steps from a single point of failure

Traditional build systems have stages that are invoked across numerous
Supply chains define all of the resources your application needs to
get into production. How those resources are created is completely up to the
resource. Cartographer, the system powering TAP supply chains, only cares
about the resource being healthy or not.

### 3KP

- "Stages" within a supply chain can use any tool they want
- Each resource within a supply chain can live across namespaces for
  additional security
- Cartographer only cares that outputs from resources are healthy. No more
  single points of failure.
